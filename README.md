### Design Features

#### Fonts:

For the logo of Critical I wanted a font that was sharp, to emphasise the idea that created the name. 
To be critical and to critique. Hence, I chose a font that was narrow to embody this idea. 
The Font I chose for this is [League Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Gothic?query=league+gothic) font.
This font is the main font for this site.

The second font I used was [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto), which is a very simple font that compliments the League Gothic font well.

#### Colours:

The main colour I used for this site is #C1EBFC, which is a light blue colour. I thought it was an very striking colour which allowed the logo to stand out. 
To compliment this I chose a few different tones of grey, which further allowed the light blue to stand out whereit was applied.
